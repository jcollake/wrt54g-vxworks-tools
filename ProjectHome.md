These tools were developed during the course of research and documentation with writing the vxworks-killer firmware images that allow for linux to be flashed onto the WRT54G v5 and similar 2MB flash models with the VxWorks operating system.

Tools include:

  * wrt\_vx\_imgtool - create, extract, and fix VxWorks firmwares
  * bsptool - modify VxWorks BOOTP params
  * more..

NOTE: I just created this project, so may not have committed everything (or anything) yet.
